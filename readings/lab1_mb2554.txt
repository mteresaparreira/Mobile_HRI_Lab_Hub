This week's reading, "Fake It to Make It", provided an interesting paradigm for the development and design of robots. I really enjoy reading alt.HRI papers, as this is the best venue for researchers to bring forth out-of-the-box and potentially disruptive ideas.

Upon reading this paper, I believe that the argument for low-cost prototyping is an interesting one. On my end, I think the main advantage really is the fact that is lowers the "barrier to entry" in the HRI field. Building robots and prototyping often requires big budgets and a lot (arguably, the majority) of countries in the World don't have the resources to develop that type of research. By validating low-cost prototyping as an approach in this field, we allow these researchers and Institutions to have their work recognized.

Personally, I am a very "qualitative-driven" researcher. I like to have a clear expectation for what the outcomes of my study might be, and design the study in a way that predicts all expected outcomes. However, I am starting to realize that there is value to video analysis/ethnographic studies, especially in very exploratory setting. This was a very good read to confront that idea.
