While  I have dabbled into the world of HRI research, even conducting my own studies, I never before had to be confronted with the challenge of designing a robot, or specific behaviors in a robot. This week’s readings, both the technical and the methodological, are resources that I will save for future research, as they provide important information.

The hardware side is something that I am completely unfamiliar with, except that I understand that it can be one of the biggest bottlenecks when running research studies. Other methods mentioned in Hoffman 14’ are also new to me, even if I have been applying them already in our lab sessions - sketching the interactions and video prototyping. Usually, I think that active discussion with colleagues is a great method for improving a design -  the questions “why this and not that?”, “what if x?” are pivotal to identifying gaps in planning that could be harmful to the experiment or robot design.

Another thing that may fit into the video prototyping genre is running pilot/exploratory studies. Pilots are *so* pertinent when it comes to ensuring that a study runs smoothly. Testing the protocol, the materials, etc, can provide really insightful information. This class is slowly changing my view on the value of ethnographic studies.
