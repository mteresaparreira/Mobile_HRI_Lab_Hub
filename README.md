[Lab 0. Mobile Robot Bootcamp](Lab0/Readme.md)

**List 5 questions you have about ROS following the tutorial, answers you have found and things you still don't get**

- What is the basic structure of ROS?
Nodes, messages and topics, publisher and subscriber nodes.
- Can nodes be subscribers and publishers at the same time?
Apparently, yes, but it's still not clear to me
- What is a topic, how would that be mapped into a real robotic system?
*no answer to this*
- More generally, how do these components fit into a robotic system? Are sensory inputs (e.g. video camera) publisher nodes? 
*no answer to this*
- The node shutdown code was not very clear to me. How do you shut down a node's activity without pressing ctrl+C?
*no answer to this*

**Feedback on the bootcamp: What was easy and what was difficult to understand?**

It was a great first introduction to ROS, really! Not too advanced, but practical enough to give us a good understanding of the structure of ROS.
